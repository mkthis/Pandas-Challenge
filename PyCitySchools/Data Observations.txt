Observed Data Trends from PyCitySchools Challenge

1. Charter schools have a significant amount more students who pass both math and reading. Charter schools percentage for passing both subjects 
sits at approximately 91%. District schools whose students pass both math and reading are at approximately 54%. 

2. Small and medium sized schools significantly outperform large schools in the amount of students passing reading and math. 
While there is virtually no difference in the passing rate in small and medium schools at approximately 90-91%, 
large schools have students pass both subjects at an approximate rate of 57%.

Based on these observations, I would recommend that the superintendent and other district leadership implement charter school-style learning at district schools, 
or form more charter schools within the district. 

Another possibility would be to study feasibility for breaking the larger schools into small or medium sized schools in an effort to concentrate resources and 
improve the percentage of students who pass math and reading.
